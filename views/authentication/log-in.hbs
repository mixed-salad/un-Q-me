  <p>
    In this challenging time of a global pandemic, helping your local friends and neighbours became more important and
    necessary than ever.<br />

    It is hard to predict when you might have to quarantine and when that happens, you have no time to go get
    groceries.<br />

    Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to have a place where people in your community (including yourself) can ask for help getting
    groceries, and support each other?<br />

    unQme was born out of the hope to reconnect you and your neighbours and rebuild a feeling of community during a time
    of increased isolation.<br />

    Post shopping lists if you are under quarantine. Take care of these shopping lists for your neighbour if you live
    close!<br />
